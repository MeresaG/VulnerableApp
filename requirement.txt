Let's start by creating a directory where the project will live. I'm going to call this directory VulnerableApp, since that is the name of the application:
	mkdir vulnerableApp
	cd vulnerableApp

If you are using a Python 3 version, virtual environment support is included in it, so all you need to do to create one is this:
	python3 -m venv venv

To activate your brand new virtual environment you use the following command:
	source venv/bin/activate

Now that you have a virtual environment created and activated, you can finally install Flask in it:
	pip3 install flask
install mysql connector database
  python3 -m pip install mysql-connector
